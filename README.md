# SmartControlwithLLM

**SmartControlwithLLM** is a PID control design tool integrated with LLM. This project aims to perform optimization and simulation of PID control systems in a GUI-based environment.

## Features

- PID control design
- Optimization algorithms: PSO and Differential Evolution
- Real-time simulation and graphical visualization
- MATLAB code generation
- Project saving and loading

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ktohma/SmartControlwithLLM.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add your API key:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=Your_API_Key_Here


## Usage

Run the `SmartControlwithLLM.py` file from the terminal or through VS Code. The GUI will launch the PID design process.
